## To Work On

### Evolution

This needs to create a new instance of next stage of Pokemon, set the IVs the same, the nature the same, the genetics the same, and replace the new Pokemon in its place in the Pokemon list with the same id number but new Pokemon name (Bulbasaur000001 becomes Ivysaur000001).
