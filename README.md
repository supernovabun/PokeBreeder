# PokeBreeder
This ~~ambitious~~ insane project is for creating a single-player text game where you breed and raise Pokemon! I don't have everything figured out yet, but it's a start.

## Currently...

As of writing this, you can run main.py without error (unless you're creative). You can move between the two rooms I've created, you have a Bulbasaur that's just sitting in your bedroom, and there's a painting in the hallway. You can also look at Bulbasaur, the rooms, and the painting. You can grab the painting too, but why would you ever do that? You can also speak, but nothing really cool happens there.

## To Work On

### Evolution

This needs to create a new instance of next stage of Pokemon, set the IVs the same, the nature the same, the genetics the same, and replace the new Pokemon in its place in the Pokemon list with the same id number but new Pokemon name (Bulbasaur000001 becomes Ivysaur000001).
